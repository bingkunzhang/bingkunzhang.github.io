  abstract={Abstract:Rating ambiguity, defined as the divergence of multiple ratings across different agencies, is often considered a problem for audience members, because extant research assumes that they use ratings for evaluation purposes and rating ambiguity makes products hard to evaluate. We extend this literature by theorizing how audience members may welcome rating ambiguity and use it to rationalize controversial decisions so that these decisions can appear simultaneously congruent with incompatible institutional demands from multiple logics. We analyze a panel dataset comprising 7,248 stocks across 67 countries between 2006 and 2021, focusing on green stocks and sin stocks that exemplify persistent incompatible institutional demands in the context of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. We find that ESG rating ambiguity increases ESG investor holding in sin stocks, an effect strengthened by the maximum score of the multiple ratings, and decreases ESG investor holding in green stocks, an effect strengthened by the minimum score. Our findings remain, after using a difference-in-differences analysis based on a regulatory shock, addressing a key alternative explanation (i.e., ESG investors prefer financial returns as a non-ambiguous criterion to ambiguous ESG ratings) and using different measures and rating coverages.}
