description:  My research explores how human capital and digital technologies can be useful in enabling collaboration within organizations. With organizational structures displaying signs of increasing decentralization, it has become important to understand alternatives to managerial hierarchies for coordinating activities within organizations. I address this through my research by studying the interplay of structure, human capital, and digital technologies, using quantitative methods applied to novel granular archival data on organization design. I also study the impact these dynamics have on performance, especially after key organizational events such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
