description:  My research interests include nonmarket strategy, sustainability, international business, and organization theory. In the area of sustainability, I explore how firms strategically respond to a variety of institutional pressures regarding sustainability efforts, such as climate policy, green finance campaign, green credit policy, and physical climate change exposure. In my recent projects, I explore the factors that drive the allocation of green human capital both within and across organizations. In the area of IB, I seek to understand how geopolitical risk influences global supply chains.
