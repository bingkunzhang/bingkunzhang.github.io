Hello! Welcome to my personal website!

I am an Assistant Professor in Strategic Management at the University of Melbourne. Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!

My research interests include nonmarket strategy, sustainability, international business, and organization theory. In the area of sustainability, I explore how firms strategically respond to a variety of institutional pressures regarding sustainability efforts, such as climate policy, green finance campaign, green credit policy, and physical climate change exposure. In my recent projects, I explore the factors that drive the allocation of green human capital both within and across organizations. In the area of IB, I seek to understand how geopolitical risk influences global supply chains.
