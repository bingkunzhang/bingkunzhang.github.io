I am a PhD candidate in Strategy at the HKU Business School, University of Hong Kong.

My research interests include nonmarket strategy, sustainability, international business, and organization theory. In the area of sustainability, I explore how firms strategically respond to a veriety of institutional pressures regarding sustainability efforts, such as climate policy, green finance campaign, green credit policy, and physical climate change exposure. In the area of IB, I seek to understand how geopolitical risk and technology change influence MNC's supply chain involvement in the host country.

I am currently on the 2024-2025 job market and you can find my CV here.
