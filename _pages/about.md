Hello! Welcome to my personal website!

I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer in Australia) in Strategy at Faculty of Business and Economics, The University of Melbourne. I hold a PhD from the HKU Business School, University of Hong Kong.

My research interests include nonmarket strategy, sustainability, strategic human capital, and organization theory. In the area of sustainability, I explore how firms strategically respond to a variety of institutional pressures regarding sustainability efforts, such as climate policy, green finance campaign, green credit policy, and physical climate change exposure. I also interested in the effects of the natural environment or environmental regulations on labor markets and human capital outcomes. In my recent working projects, I explore the factors that drive the allocation of human capital both within and across organizations, and how organizations adjust human capital investment in response to external shocks. 

Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions!
